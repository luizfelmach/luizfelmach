Keeping at HEAD~0

Hello, I'm Luiz, a 21 year old Computer Engineering student at the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo. Passionate about Linux, I thrive on diving into the depths of Mathematics and Physics, constantly seeking to broaden my understanding of these subjects.

Always looking to improve my knowledge of algorithms and data structure. I have experience in C, C++, Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript and more. I also have experience with tools that help with development, such as Docker, Git, Bash, Database and much more.

I use Arch BTW !!!
